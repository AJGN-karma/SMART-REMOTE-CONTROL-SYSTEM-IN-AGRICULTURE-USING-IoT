## Overview
This project integrates ESP32-based sensors (soil moisture, temperature, humidity) with Firebase and a web dashboard to enable real-time monitoring and remote control of irrigation systems. It addresses water inefficiency, manual labor, and limited visibility into field conditions—offering automation, resource optimization, and improved crop productivity.

## Tech Stack
- **Hardware**: ESP32, soil moisture + DHT sensors, relays
- **Cloud**: Firebase Realtime Database
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Chart.js
- **IDE**: Arduino IDE, VS Code

## Features
- Real-time field data monitoring and visualization
- Remote control of irrigation hardware
- Alert mechanisms for threshold breaches
- Easy deployment using affordable components

## Installation & Setup
1. Clone the repo  
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smart-agri-iot.git
    cd smart-agri-iot
    ```
2. Install frontend dependencies (if any):  
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3. Flash the ESP32 firmware in `src/` using Arduino IDE and configure Firebase credentials.
4. Update `docs/installation.md` for full setup steps.

## Usage
Launch `index.html` in your browser. You’ll see real-time charts and pump control options.
